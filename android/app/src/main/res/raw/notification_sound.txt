This is a placeholder for the notification sound file.

To add a custom notification sound:

1. Replace this file with an actual .mp3 or .wav file
2. Name it "notification_sound.mp3" or "notification_sound.wav"
3. Make sure the file is not too large (recommended < 1MB)
4. The sound should be short and pleasant (1-3 seconds)

You can find free notification sounds on:

The notification service will automatically use this sound for appointment notifications.
